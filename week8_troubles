Home page:
	Navbar needs to be global
	We tried using regions and subregions and buttons - front end design could not be achieved.
	We need dynamic action on the navbar buttons:
			The locations 
			The company
			The culture
		We might consider another design since it would be ideal to use apex buttons for this, it has been difficult to achieve the design using apex buttons.
	The footer needs to be global

Building Page:
	Nabber and footer need to be global.
	Submenu buttons need to be filled dynamically
	We need to rework the submenu since it does not resize properly.
	We could use info in the database to have information to display.
	The template uses more regions and subregions and buttons than the Home page.

We need to confirm the ddls were put together and imported correctly to our app.
How can we share the workspace.

Lets try to get the database to update when submitting info on the sign in page.
